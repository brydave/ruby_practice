# Write the program we talked about at the very beginning of this chapter.
# Hint: There's a lovely array method which will give you a sorted version of an array:  sort. Use it!

# Let's write a program which asks us to type in as many words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an empty line), and which then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order. OK?
